# LOTR SDK Playground

Welcome to the LOTR SDK Playground! This app built with Next.js allows users to explore the world of The Lord of the Rings, including the books, movies, characters and quotes. All of the content is accessible on a single page via tabs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have it yet, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installation

Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone this repo to your local machine and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Running the App

After the dependencies have been installed, you can run the following command to start the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the app and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. You can view it in your browser of choice.

## Design System

This app uses the [Semantic UI for React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) design system. It is a great way to quickly build high-quality user interfaces.

## Data Source

This app uses the [baddley-lotr-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/baddley-lotr-sdk) package from npm to get all of the data for display. This package provides a convenient way to access data related to The Lord of the Rings universe.
